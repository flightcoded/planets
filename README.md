This is a simple 2D gravitational attraction simulation. Collisions are presumed to be happening on the centers of the bodies and result in merging. If a body reaches a certain radius, it collapses into a black hole.

Also included is a p5.js version. See it working <a href ="http://catheart.xyz/plabets">here</a>.

Feel free to let me know about any issue or idea.
